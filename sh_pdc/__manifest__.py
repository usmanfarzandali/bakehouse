    "description": """In Invoice/Bill, a post-dated cheque is a cheque written by the customer/vendor (payer) for a date in the future. Whether a post-dated cheque may be cashed or deposited before the date written on it depends on the country. Currently, odoo does not provide any kind of feature to manage post-dated cheque. That why we make this module, it will help to manage a post-dated cheque with an accounting journal entries. This module provides a feature to Register PDC Cheque in an account. This module allows to manage postdated cheque for the customer as well vendors, you can easily track/move to a different state of cheque like new, registered, return, deposit, bounce, done.
